# Style and classify any image
Uses machine learning to change the style and classify an image retrieved from the web (or from a preloaded sample).

## The Jupyter notebok contains three modules:
#### 1. Scraper
  Upon a text prompt, returns a url to the desired image from the web using google search
#### 2. Styler
  - Uses a pretrained deep learning model to add the desired style to any image
#### 3. Classifier
  - Deep leaning model to classify an image (within the model's categories)

*These modules work standalone or together. For example, the output of the Scraper can be passed as the content image to the Styler and / or to the Classifier.*
